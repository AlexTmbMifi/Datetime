# Datetime
The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.// Python

I will try to show what kinda problems can be solved with that module. 

Datatime represents many functions to make applications more attractive for users and administrators. It allows to registrate new users and save all their info in current time and date. 
Moreover, it is really possible to measure the time interval of working funcs.
